## About 

QM encoder is an adaptive binary arithmetic coding procedure which is widely used in entropy coding such as JPEG. It involves sub division of intervals recursively. Iâ€™ve implemented QM coding using the algorithm given, and has compared the performance of QM encoding on various data files.


## Progress
